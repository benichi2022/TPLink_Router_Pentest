Although the attack surface of IoT devices spans multiple areas such as web, networks, firmware and even hardware. In this task, I will be focusing firmware analysis including extraction and in addition, connecting to the shell over UART \
A typical penetration test includes the following phases at high level:
1) Information Gathering
2) Enumeration
3) Exploitation
4) Post-Exploitation

I will try to map whatever I do to the aformentioned phases as much as possible.

## Phase 1: Information Gathering
Let's first search for publicly available information about our router based on the model number and FCCID

## Phase 3: Exploitation
### Firmware Analysis
I will be analyzing the firmware of TL-WR841N router that was extracted from the device ROM. It is also possible to download the desired firmware from TP Link official website. In the downloaded zip file, there is the firmware - the file with .bin extension and two documents regarding the license and how to upgrade the router's firmware.

The firmware is protected under GNU GPL license or the GNU General Public License which gives freedom to analyze the firmware binary.
Let's define what a firmware is, shall we? A firmware is a specialized software that provides low-level control of the computing device hardware. It is stored in non-volatile memory such as the ROM, Flash or EEPROM, we will see how to extract firmware from the device as well. The firmware has the following prominent sections - the bootloader, the kernel and the root filesystem.
